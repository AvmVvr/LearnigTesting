Polymorphism: 

poly -- > Many
morpism --> Form

One task can be complete in many ways

Two Types:
Method overloading (Compiletime polymorphism/Static Binding)
Method overriding (Runtime Polymorphism/Dynamic Binding)

Method overloading:
--> In a class, methods name will be same, parameters and arguments will be differ 
based on
	data type 
	data type count
	data type order

Method overriding (Runtime Polymorphism/Dynamic Binding)

we have two different class, methods name and parameters name will be same

Type Casting:
Upcasting: Assiging child class into parent class
Downcasting: Assigning parent class into the child class, which is not possible in java
