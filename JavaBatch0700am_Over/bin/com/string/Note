String -->	Sequence of character
		--> Non Primitive Data type
	represent ---> double quote
Ex. "Java"

Literal String:
	It’s stored inside the heap memory (string pool or string constant).
	It will share the memory if same value (duplicate value)

Non-literal string:
	Its stored in the heap memory.
	Its create a new memory every time even if its duplicate value(same value)
	
Immutable string:
We can store more duplicate value in same memory
We can't change the value in memory
using concat method , it’s have to create new memory

Mutable string:
we can't store duplicate value in same memory
we can change the value in memory
Using append , its takes same memory
