Variable :
		It is a container that stores the value/groups of values
	
	types : 3 
		1. Local Variable
		2. Class Variable
		3. Static Variable
		
	Local Variable: (LV)/(Method Variable)
	 
	 1. This variable will be assigned inside the method.
	 2. Life of the Local Variable is inside the specific method only.
	 3. LV must be assigned to the values.
	 4. using Obj.reference we call the particular method
	  
	  Class Variable::(CV)
	  1. we declare class variable inside the class but outside of the methods
	  2.life of CV is entire class
	  3.if variable(CV/LV) name same ---> LV holds the high priority
	  4. need not to assign the value to the variable ; it has default values.
	  5. using Obj.reference we call the particular method 
	  
	  Static Variable:(Global Variable)
	  1. Same as class Variable but in prefix we add "static" keyword to that variable.
	  2. without using Obj.reference we call the static variable.
